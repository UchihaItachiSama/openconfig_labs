# Phase-1

## Overview

This folder contains `demo` and `challenge_labs` sub-folders.

The `demo` sub-folder will contain scripts/commands being used in the training which you can copy and work along with the trainer during the training.

The `challenge_labs` sub-folder contains challenge labs for practice as per the trainer's instructions. The folder also contains solution file, but we would recommend to not take a peek at those first :)

Under each folder, you will find details and instructions about the topic in the README.md file.

For any queries or issues please reach out to the maintainer.

## Note

All the YANG modules from `https://github.com/openconfig/public.git` have been copied to the `yang_modules` directory.
